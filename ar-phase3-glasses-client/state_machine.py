"""
State machine for on-demand identification: Standby -> Targeting -> Matching -> Anchored.

Timings match the spec exactly so the phone/glasses split can be tuned without
touching this file:
  - saccade filter:     gaze must hold on a target for > SACCADE_FLOOR_MS
                         before Targeting even begins (spec: rapid eye
                         movements under 150ms never trigger anything)
  - dwell timer:         DWELL_MS of continued gaze -> fires a single-frame capture
  - match window:        MATCH_TIMEOUT_MS to get a result back before giving up
  - anchor persistence:  once Anchored, the camera goes back to idle; only
                         low-power spatial tracking (SLAM) keeps the card pinned

This class has no camera, network, or rendering code in it on purpose — it only
decides *when* those things should happen. Wire it to real sensors via the
callbacks passed into `GazePipeline` (see pipeline.py).
